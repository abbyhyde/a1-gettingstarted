This project shows basic HTML, CSS, and JS elements through a website about myself. 

### Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules to different text tags (.header, h4, h5, a, li), other physical elements (hr, img), and sections (.column, #exp, #courses, .row:after). 
- **Added a JS animation**: I animated the colors of my name at the top of the page to rotate through the colors of the color palatte (besides the background color). 
- **Extra HTML Tags**: I used the div, hr, span, img, and br tags. The div tag was used to divide the header section from the rest of the page, as well as implement columns for the rest of the page. The hr tag was used to provide a visual divide between the header and the rest of the page. The span tag was used to encapsulate the four columns of the coursework section. The img tag was used to insert a picture of myself hiking. The br tag was used to add extra space so the page would be more visually appealing. 

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Created a Coolors color palatte**: I used Coolors to create a palatte of four colors for my website. I chose four colors to have a text color, background color, and two accent colors (for the hr and link).
